### This is a Case #4 BlackJack c++ Game for the CIS7 Project.

- This project was published in December 8th, 2023.
- This Project was created by TPR, Eric Kim. Which was independently made.
How to Use the Blackjack Program:
- 1: Starting the Program:
- Run the Blackjack program in your preferred C++ environment.
- The program will initialize and display the initial hands of the player and the dealer.
  
- 2: Understanding the Display:
- You will see the "Player hand" and "Dealer hand" displayed on the screen.
- The dealer's second card is initially hidden (represented as "???").
  
- 3: Initial Winning Probability:
- The program will calculate and show the initial winning probability for the player based on the current hand.
  
- 4: Player's Turn:
- The program will prompt you with: "Do you want to hit? (y/n):"
- Type 'y' if you want to draw an additional card (hit).
- Type 'n' if you want to keep your current hand (stand).
  
- 5: Drawing Cards:
- If you choose to hit, a new card will be drawn and displayed.
- The program will update the player's hand and calculate the updated winning probability.
  
- 6: Bust Check:
- If your hand exceeds 21 after drawing a card, the program will declare a bust, and you lose the game.
  
- 7: Dealer's Turn:
- After you decide to stand or if you bust, the dealer will reveal their hidden card and draw cards until their hand reaches at least 17.
  
- 8: Determining the Winner:
- The program will compare the final hands of the player and the dealer to determine the winner.
- If the dealer busts or your hand is closer to 21 without busting, you win.
- If the hands are equal, it's a tie. Otherwise, the dealer wins.
  
- 9: End of the Game:
- The program will announce the winner and display the final hands of both the player and the dealer.
  
- 10: Restarting the Game:
- You can run the program again to play another round.

TIPS:
- Pay attention to the initial winning probability to make informed decisions.
- Be cautious when deciding to hit, as drawing additional cards carries the risk of busting.

NOTE:
- The program uses a simplified deck of cards (2 to 11) with 11 representing an Ace.
Enjoy the Blackjack experience, and have fun playing!
